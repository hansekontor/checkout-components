[bcash](https://github.com/badger-cash/bcash) (eCash Edition) is an alternative implementation of the eCash protocol,
written in node.js.

This repository contains parts of [bcash](https://github.com/badger-cash/bcash) and compatible libraries such as [bcrypto](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcrypto), [bfilter](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bfilter) and [b70](https://github.com/badger-cash/b70).

Thereby, projects built on eCash that do not require to run a node can use a lighter dependency. 

## Uses
- General Purpose Bitcoin Library

npm install @hansekontor/checkout-components
